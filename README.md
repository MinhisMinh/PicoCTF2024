# PicoCTF2024
Finding a wonderful solution to all of the problems I have solved during this contest

Hi everyone, my name is Minh and I am currently a freshman at the University of Information Technology in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This is the first time I have learned and played CTF so I hope I can get more feedback about my write-up problem in picoCTF2024 <3

I love doing some "investigating stuff" so I chose Forensics to start off and btw I already had some experience before doing this contest by all clear general skills and a few basic problems in forensics and crypto before I joined the contest.

P/S: Please shout out to minu2k5 who assist a lot by giving hints so that I can easily do research and know more tools <3
